## 5. Clear evaluation criteria
Define success metrics and baseline performance or usability expectations to determine whether a feature is ready for release.

### 5.1 Success metrics
- **Feature success**:
  Features succeed more then 98% of the time (ex: adding a post on the wall page succeeds, assigning user to a task succeeds).
  To get metric, send message from app to server upon success/failure of feature.

- **Responsiveness**:
  Server requests response time stay lower than 500ms for small request (not for big data transfers like images)

### 5.2 Baseline expectations
- **Usability Baseline**:
  95% of testers rate the interface as "easy to use"
